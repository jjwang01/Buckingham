20 minutes before to 5 minutes after to find a glucose value if you find a sensor glucose error (patient did not calibrate sensor)

just graph the data first for each day
	mean stdev error bars later

put on same scale (0 - 300)
put on same graph

separate breakfast and dinner
	1 hour before each breakfast bolus to 3 hours after
	1 hour before each dinner to 8 hours after

	meal bolus -> t = 0
		first, don't scale (raw glucose values)
		if appropriate, use deltas 

annotate how clean or dirty the data is (e.g. correction boluses in the graph)
